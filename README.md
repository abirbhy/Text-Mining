# Text-Mining

In this project, we developed a Python application that:

*) reads a text document (article, paragraph, tweet, Facebook post, TripAdvisor review, movie description, etc.)

*) returns its category (sport, business, â€¦.)

*) detects its main topics

*) summarizes it automatically to produce most important and relevant sentences in order (2 sentences or more)

*) identifies the emotional tone in it: whether positive or negative or neutral
